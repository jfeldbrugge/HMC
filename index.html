<p>The Hamiltonian or Hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) method is an elegant way
to sample nontrivial distributions in probability theory based on
physical intuitions. It was developed by algorithm was originally
proposed by Simon Duane, Anthony Kennedy, Brian Pendleton and Duncan
Roweth in 1987 for calculations in lattice quantum chromodynamic (see
the
<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/037026938791197X?via%3Dihub">
paper</a>). These notes serve as a brief introduction to the core of the
HMC method for sampling distributions, inspired by the great
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.02434">review</a> by Michael
Betancourt.</p>
<p>The classification of surfaces asserts that every connected closed
compact surface is topologically homeomorphic to either a sphere, a
sphere with a number of handles or crosscaps. This theorem has been
known since the 1860’s, but was recently simplified by John H. Conway
(1992), known as the Zero Irrelevance Proof or in sort the ZIP proof. I
will here describe a beautiful topological proof for the classification
of combinatorial surfaces. These notes are based on
<a href="">combinatorial topology of surfaces</a> by Robert C. James
(1955), <a href="">Conway’s ZIP proof</a> by Francis and Weeks (1999),

page</a>.</p>
<p>We start by defining combinatorial surfaces and illustrating the
construct with several examples.</p>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> <em>A <strong>combinatorial
surface</strong> is a finite set of <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gons where every edge identified with a
direction and a label, such that every label occurs twice.</em></p>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>
<strong><em>Orientability</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> <em>The <strong>Euler
charateristic</strong> of a polygon with <span
class="math inline">\(V\)</span> vertices, <span
class="math inline">\(E\)</span> edges, and <span
class="math inline">\(F\)</span> faces, is given by</em></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\chi = V - E +F\]</span></p>

<p><strong>Theorem:</strong> <em>Every connected closed compact surface
is homeomorphic to either a sphere, a sphere with <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-handles, or a sphere with <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span> crosscaps.</em></p>
<p><strong>Proof:</strong> <em>We start with the definition of a
<strong>combinatorial surface</strong></em></p>
